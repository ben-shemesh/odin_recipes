    <h1>Lets make some Hummus ðŸ˜‹.</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      If falafel is Israelâ€™s national dish, then hummus has to be a close
      second. While we tend to think of it as a dip, in Israel hummus can play
      any role â€“ including a main meal in itself. Locals will all have their own
      favourite places to get hummus, and itâ€™s as talked about as anything else
      in Israel, but any you try in the country will be far better than what you
      get in British supermarkets. The basic combination of chickpeas, tahini,
      garlic and lemon is tasty enough on its own, but there are many
      variations. Some include cumin, many are sprinkled with sumac and others
      are topped with pine nuts; thereâ€™s even hummus with fried ground meat on
      top. It might sound a little strange, but hummus is traditionally eaten
      with large slices of raw, sweet onion, which are dunked like a piece of
      pitta â€“ delicious.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chickpeas(3 cups)</strong>: Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo
        beans, are the star ingredient in hummus. Canned or dry chickpeas? If
        you're wondering how to make hummus from scratch--the best, extra
        creamy, authentic stuff--you'll want to cook your own chickpeas from
        scratch (you'll give them a good soak overnight + boil in water until
        well-done. More on this later)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic (1 or 2 cloves</strong>: Start with 1 clove and make sure
        it is finely minced.<strong
          >Tip: to tame its pungency, allow minced garlic to sit in a little bit
          of lemon juice for a few minutes.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tahini (â…“ cup)</strong>: Tahini is a rich, nutty and slightly
        bitter paste made from toasted sesame seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh Lemon Juice (from 1 lemon)</strong>: Fresh lemon juice is
        just the thing to add tang here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kosher Salt</strong>: Just a pinch of kosher salt to your
        liking. You can always add more. If you're interested in adding
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong>: A generous drizzle of quality
        extra virgin olive oil is the way to finish and serve this dip the
        authentic way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish</strong>: Not to be underestimated. My favorite way to
        garnish a bowl of hummus, once the EVOO has been poured nicely right in
        the middle, is a few pinches of tangy sumac (sometimes ground cumin is a
        good addition). If you have some extra cooked chickpeas, plant them
        right in the middle. For a pop of green, you can add a garnish of fresh
        parsley.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Hummus: Step-by-Step</h3>
    <p>Time needed: 20 minutes.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Soak and cook the chickpeas</strong>: <br />
        <em
          >If using dry chickpeas allow extra time for soaking (overnight) and
          cooking (2 hours).</em
        ><br />
        Take 1 cup dry chickpeas and place it in a large bowl. Add plenty of
        water and soak overnight (chickpeas will expand in the bowl).
        <br />
        <br />
        When ready, drain chickpeas and place them in a medium-sized heavy
        cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches.<br />
        Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 Â½ to 2 hours. You
        should end up with about 3 cups of cooked chickpeas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peel the chickpeas</strong>: Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot
        water and add 1 Â½ teaspoon baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. <br />
        Take a handful of chickpeas and rub under running water to remove the
        skins. Discard skins. Let the chickpeas cool completely before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Puree the chickpeas in a food processor</strong>: Dry the
        chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor
        that's fitted with a blade.<br />
        Run the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like
        paste
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the rest and keep blending</strong>: While the food
        processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice.
        Blend for about 4 minutes or so.<br />
        Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and
        slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky
        smooth consistency.<br />
        At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or
        so before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish</strong>: Spread in a
        serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil.
        Add a few chickpeas to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top.
        Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies and some warm pita
        bread.
