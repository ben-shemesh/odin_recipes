    <h1>Lets make some Hummus ðŸ˜‹.</h1>

    <p>
      If falafel is Israelâ€™s national dish, then hummus has to be a close
      second. While we tend to think of it as a dip, in Israel hummus can play
      any role â€“ including a main meal in itself. Locals will all have their own
      favourite places to get hummus, and itâ€™s as talked about as anything else
      in Israel, but any you try in the country will be far better than what you
      get in British supermarkets. The basic combination of chickpeas, tahini,
      garlic and lemon is tasty enough on its own, but there are many
      variations. Some include cumin, many are sprinkled with sumac and others
      are topped with pine nuts; thereâ€™s even hummus with fried ground meat on
      top. It might sound a little strange, but hummus is traditionally eaten
      with large slices of raw, sweet onion, which are dunked like a piece of
      pitta â€“ delicious.
