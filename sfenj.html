      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        A Maghreb dish originating from
        <strong> Morocco and northwest Africa</strong>, sfenj is Israel’s answer
        to doughnuts. They’re one of the most popular street foods in the
        country, with traders standing behind huge barrels of oil full of
        sizzling, crisp sfenj. They’re made from a simple unsweetened dough
        that’s left to rise before being shaped into rings or discs and
        deep-fried then dusted with sugar. Sfenj need to be eaten straight after
        cooking, or they lose their famous texture, so they’re always best when
        eaten on the street.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/4 warm cups water, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar or confectioners' sugar, optional</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Make Sfenj: Step-by-Step</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water and
          set aside to proof for 10 or 15 minute
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine the flour with the salt and the remaining 1
          cup warm water. Add the yeast mixture and stir vigorously with your
          hand or a heavy wooden spoon until smooth. The dough should be too
          sticky to knead or shape, almost like a thick batter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the bowl with a towel and leave the dough to rise for 3 to 4
          hours, until double or triple in bulk.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a wide, deep pot, heat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil over medium
          heat until hot
        </li>
        <li>
          Set out a bowl of water. Dip your hands in the water, then pull off a
          piece of dough about the size of a small plum. Use your fingers to
          make a hole in the ball of dough, stretch the hole wide to make a
          ring, and place the dough in the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat with additional portions of dough until you've added as many
          sfenj as will fit comfortably in your pot; do not overcrowd. Wet your
          hands as necessary to keep the dough from sticking as you work with
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the sfenj until golden brown, turning once or twice. Remove the
          cooked sfenj to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat shaping and frying until you've used up all the dough.</li>
        <li>
          If desired, finish the hot sfenj by dipping in granulated sugar or by
          dusting with powdered sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the sfenj hot or warm; they lose their texture and appeal when
          cold.
        </li>
      </ol>
