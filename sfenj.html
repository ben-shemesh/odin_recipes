    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A Maghreb dish originating from
      <strong> Morocco and northwest Africa</strong>, sfenj is Israel’s answer
      to doughnuts. They’re one of the most popular street foods in the country,
      with traders standing behind huge barrels of oil full of sizzling, crisp
      sfenj. They’re made from a simple unsweetened dough that’s left to rise
      before being shaped into rings or discs and deep-fried then dusted with
      sugar. Sfenj need to be eaten straight after cooking, or they lose their
      famous texture, so they’re always best when eaten on the street.
