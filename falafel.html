    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Falafel is Israelâ€™s <strong>national dish</strong>, and if youâ€™re a fan of
      these famous chickpea fritters then youâ€™ll not go hungry. Falafel are
      eaten across the Middle East and most Arab countries, and the dishâ€™s
      origins border on the mythical â€“ many different countries claim to have
      invented them, although most records indicate they originally came from
      Egypt. Wherever falafel comes from, it has been fully adopted into Israeli
      cuisine, and is a daily staple for many. When it comes to street food
      falafel, theyâ€™re usually stuffed into pitta bread with plenty of hummus,
      tahini sauce, pickles and salad, with fresh tomatoes and fried aubergine
      adding even more flavour. If thereâ€™s one thing you need to eat while in
      Israel, itâ€™s this.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Driedn chickpea</strong>: AVOID using canned chickpeas! Dried
        chickpeas (that have been soaked in water for 24 hours) are an important
        ingredient that will give your falafel the right consistency and taste.
        (Tip: I usually add about Â½ teaspoon of baking soda to the soaking water
        to help soften the dry chickpeas.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs</strong> fresh parsley, cilantro, and dill are key
        to this authentic recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion</strong> I typically use yellow onions, but white or red
        onions would work.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Garlic</strong> for best flavor, use fresh garlic cloves.</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and pepper: to taste.</li>
      <li>
        <strong> Spices</strong> cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper.
        Along with the fresh herbs, this trio of spices is what gives falafel
        it's bold authentic taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder</strong> this is what gives falafel an airy,
        fluffy texture (many recipes skip this, causing the falafel to come out
        too dense.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sesame seeds</strong> these are optional here, but I do like the
        added nuttiness.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Falafel: Step-by-Step</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Soak chickpeas for 24 hours</strong>: Cover them in plenty of
        water and add baking soda to help soften them as they soak. The
        chickpeas will at least double in size as they soak. Drain very well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make mixture</strong>: Add chickpeas, fresh herbs (parsley,
        cilantro, and dill), garlic, onion, and spices to food processor and
        pulse a little bit at a time until the mixture is finely ground. Youâ€™ll
        know itâ€™s ready when the texture is more like coarse meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form patties or balls</strong>: Once the falafel mixture has
        been plenty chilled, stir in baking powder and toasted sesame seeds,
        then scoop golf ball-sized balls and form into balls or patties (if you
        go the patties route, do not flatten them too much, you want them to
        still be nice and fluffy when they're cooked.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry</strong>: Frying is the traditional way to cook falafel and
        yields the most authentic and best result. Heat the oil on medium-high
        until it bubbles softly (your oil should be hot enough around 375
        degrees F, but not too hot that it causes the falafel to fall apart.)
        <br />
        Carefully drop the falafel in the oil, using a slotted spoon, and fry
        for 3-5 minutes until medium brown on the outside. Avoid over-crowding
        the falafel; fry them in batches if necessary.
        <br />
        <strong>Tip</strong>: it's always a good idea to fry one falafel first
        to make sure the oil temperature does not need to be adjusted.
