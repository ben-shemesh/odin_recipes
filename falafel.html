    <h1>Lets make some Falafel ðŸ˜‹.</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Falafel is Israelâ€™s <strong>national dish</strong>, and if youâ€™re a fan of
      these famous chickpea fritters then youâ€™ll not go hungry. Falafel are
      eaten across the Middle East and most Arab countries, and the dishâ€™s
      origins border on the mythical â€“ many different countries claim to have
      invented them, although most records indicate they originally came from
      Egypt. Wherever falafel comes from, it has been fully adopted into Israeli
      cuisine, and is a daily staple for many. When it comes to street food
      falafel, theyâ€™re usually stuffed into pitta bread with plenty of hummus,
      tahini sauce, pickles and salad, with fresh tomatoes and fried aubergine
      adding even more flavour. If thereâ€™s one thing you need to eat while in
      Israel, itâ€™s this.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Driedn chickpea</strong>: AVOID using canned chickpeas! Dried
        chickpeas (that have been soaked in water for 24 hours) are an important
        ingredient that will give your falafel the right consistency and taste.
        (Tip: I usually add about Â½ teaspoon of baking soda to the soaking water
        to help soften the dry chickpeas.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh herbs: fresh parsley, cilantro, and dill are key to this authentic
        recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: I typically use yellow onions, but white or red onions would
        work.
      </li>
      <li>Garlic: for best flavor, use fresh garlic cloves.</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and pepper: to taste.</li>
      <li>
        Spices: cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper. Along with the
        fresh herbs, this trio of spices is what gives falafel it's bold
        authentic taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: this is what gives falafel an airy, fluffy texture (many
        recipes skip this, causing the falafel to come out too dense.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sesame seeds: these are optional here, but I do like the added
        nuttiness.
      </li>
    </ul>
