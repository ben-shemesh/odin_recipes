      Falafel is Israelâ€™s <strong>national dish</strong>, and if youâ€™re a fan of
      these famous chickpea fritters then youâ€™ll not go hungry. Falafel are
      eaten across the Middle East and most Arab countries, and the dishâ€™s
      origins border on the mythical â€“ many different countries claim to have
      invented them, although most records indicate they originally came from
      Egypt. Wherever falafel comes from, it has been fully adopted into Israeli
      cuisine, and is a daily staple for many. When it comes to street food
      falafel, theyâ€™re usually stuffed into pitta bread with plenty of hummus,
      tahini sauce, pickles and salad, with fresh tomatoes and fried aubergine
      adding even more flavour. If thereâ€™s one thing you need to eat while in
      Israel, itâ€™s this.
