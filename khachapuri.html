      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        4. Khachapuri image It might be Georgiaâ€™s national dish, but khachapuri
        has fast become one of Israelâ€™s most popular dishes for breakfast and
        brunch on the go. The large Georgian-Israeli community are responsible
        for some of the best bakeries in the country, and itâ€™s thanks to dishes
        like these that theyâ€™re held in such high regard. A simple pastry shaped
        a little like a boat, khachapuri is stuffed with plenty of cheese and
        topped with a fried egg. Itâ€™s cheap, very tasty and perfect for a lazy
        start to the weekend. Vendors tend to offer a variety of toppings in
        Israel, too, filling the pastry with beans for a vegan option or going
        all-out with prawns, squid and garlic butter.

      <h3>How to Make Khachapuri: Step-by-Step</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the dough </strong>: In a small saucepan over low, heat
          1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 milliliters water until hot but not
          simmering. Turn off heat. In a large bowl, with your hands or a wooden
          spoon, stir together flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Check the
          temperature of reserved, warmed water; it should be warm to the touch,
          between 105 and 110 degrees. Add it to the flour mixture and, with
          your hands, knead mixture into a smooth dough, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pour olive oil into a medium bowl</strong>: Holding dough with
          one hand, use it to coat the inside of the bowl with the oil. Set the
          dough in the bowl, oiled portion facing up. Cover bowl with a damp
          cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it doubled in
          volume, about 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heat oven to 450 degrees</strong>: Line a half sheet tray with
          parchment paper; set aside. On a lightly floured surface, stretch and
          roll dough into a circle, 1/4-inch thick, 10 to 12 inches across.
          Brush off excess flour, then lay the dough on the sheet tray. Using
          your fingers, roll, press and pinch two opposite sides of the circle a
          few inches into the center, building sides up, then press and pinch
          the narrow ends together to form two points. Continue to pinch and
          press the sides to create a raised rim and form the dough into an oval
          boat with an eye-like shape. Let rest in a warm place while you
          prepare the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In a medium bowl</strong>: combine mozzarella, goat cheese and
          feta with 3 tablespoons water. Stir with a fork until the mixture is
          thoroughly blended. Scrape the cheese mixture into the center of the
          dough boat, spreading it into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake khachapuri</strong>: until the crust begins to brown and
          the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven, leaving
          oven on. Brush sides of khachapuri generously with melted butter.
          Return khachapuri to the oven for an additional 5 minutes until the
          crust is extra crisp and the cheese just starts to brown around the
          edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Using a spoon</strong>: make a shallow, 2-inch-wide well in
          the center of the cheese. Add the egg yolk and cold butter (if using),
          and serve immediately. To serve, hold down one pointed end of the hot
          khachapuri with a fork; using another fork, quickly stir the egg and
          butter (if using) into the cheese mixture until itâ€™s smooth and
          stretchy. Rip pieces of the bread boat off to dip in the cheese while
          itâ€™s still hot.
