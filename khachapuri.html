    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      4. Khachapuri image It might be Georgiaâ€™s national dish, but khachapuri
      has fast become one of Israelâ€™s most popular dishes for breakfast and
      brunch on the go. The large Georgian-Israeli community are responsible for
      some of the best bakeries in the country, and itâ€™s thanks to dishes like
      these that theyâ€™re held in such high regard. A simple pastry shaped a
      little like a boat, khachapuri is stuffed with plenty of cheese and topped
      with a fried egg. Itâ€™s cheap, very tasty and perfect for a lazy start to
      the weekend. Vendors tend to offer a variety of toppings in Israel, too,
      filling the pastry with beans for a vegan option or going all-out with
      prawns, squid and garlic butter.
